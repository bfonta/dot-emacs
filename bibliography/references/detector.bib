abstract="The semiconductor component and circuit operation in a radiation environment, as outlined in Chap. 1, is generally subjected to a mix of particles and photons, with quite a range of energies. Upon its trajectory through the material, a high-energy nuclear particle or photon may lose its kinetic energy in different ways, thereby creating various types of damage. This chapter describes the different interaction and damage mechanisms. Roughly speaking, they can be divided into ionisation and displacement damage effects, which are discussed in the Sect. 2.2. The impact of both damage mechanisms on material and device parameters and characteristics is the subject of Sect. 2.3. Examples are given for the case of silicon and the silicon-silicondioxide (Si-Si02) interface, as they are the dominant systems in advanced microelectronics and, therefore, also the best studied. Whenever relevant, results for other semiconductor materials (Ge, GaAs,...) are given. Specific damage mechanisms for III-V and opto-electronic components are addressed in the chapters dealing with these applications. In Sect. 2.4, a brief description is provided of the most powerful spectroscopic techniques, enabling a microscopic study of the radiation-induced defects. Final conclusions are drawn in Sect. 2.5.",
